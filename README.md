# Lab

Where I run experiments and learn by doing.

This project was initially created to help visualize algorithms. I only ever got through quick-sort though, so that didn't really pan out. But I then started using this to play around with CSS animations and SVG. Then functional programming. Then some random stuff like [creating a logo for RxDB](https://lab.iansinnott.com/playground).

Now this is a place where I put anything. It's a good repo for testing out web tech and putting it online quickly.

**Quick Start:**

* `yarn install`
* `yarn start` to run a dev server
* `yarn build` to minify, package and generate static HTML files from your routes
* `yarn deploy` to deploy to surge.sh
